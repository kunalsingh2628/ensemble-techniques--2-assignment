    "The choice of base learner can impact the bias-variance tradeoff in bagging. Bagging tends to reduce variance by averaging or combining predictions from different models, but its effect on bias depends on the base learner.\n",

    "Highly Flexible Base Learners: If the base learner is highly flexible (e.g., deep decision trees), bagging can help reduce overfitting and variance, leading to a decrease in overall model variance. However, it may not significantly affect bias because the individual models are already capable of fitting the training data well.\n",

    "Highly Constrained Base Learners: If the base learner is constrained (e.g., shallow decision trees), bagging can help reduce bias by combining different models that may capture complementary aspects of the data. It can still reduce variance, but the impact on bias might be more noticeable compared to using flexible base learners.\n",
